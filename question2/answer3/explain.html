Ans. In the script tag after correcting the quotes in the script tag the external js file "script.js" is loaded.
First alert pushes an alert notification with the text "I'm JavaScript!"
Second alert is not having semicolon, even if no semicolon is present JS automatically adds semicolon at the end a line if not present.
The second alert pushes an alert notification with text "Hello"
The tag can be in continued in the following lines as long as the quotes and bracket is closed correctly.
The JavaScript compiler treats it as one line and executes the third alert with text "Wor ld" in different lines,
The fourth alert prints 6 as the JavaScript compiler allows basic arthmetic inside the alert syntax. The alert is executed after running the operations inside it.
